                <p class="main-article__paragraph">The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel by the English
                    author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth, the story
                    began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit, but
                    eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between
                    1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling books
                    ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.</p>

                    <p>Bilbo celebrates his eleventy-first (111th) birthday and leaves the Shire suddenly, passing the
                        Ring to Frodo Baggins, his cousin[e] and heir. Neither hobbit is aware of the Ring's origin, but
                        the wizard Gandalf suspects it is a Ring of Power. Seventeen years later, in "The Shadow of the
                        Past", Gandalf confirms to Frodo that the Ring is the one lost by the Dark Lord Sauron long ago
                        and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return by
                        Frodo's birthday and accompany Frodo on his journey, but fails to do so...</p>

                        Grishnákh, attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but
